# etl-challenge

This collaboration was compiled between Greg Maginn and Ivan Montelongo in an effort to put into practice data ETL. 

ETL refers to the actions of Extracting data from multiple sources, Transforming the data to clean it up into more relatable data, 
and finally loading it into a final database. 

The ETL-Challenge utilizes two Comma Separated Value files:
- U.S. Gasoline and Diesel Retail Prices 1995-2021
- Zillo Econimics Data on Housing Price per Square Foot.

Utilizing this data, we propose to compare the U.S. Retail Gas Prices from 1996 - 2021 vs. Housing Price per square foot; to compare the impact of inflation on the average household.
